//! Network protocol types used by the P2P layer.
//!
//! This module defines the wire-level message types exchanged between peers:
//! - Gossip messages (gossipsub): broadcast transactions, new blocks and chain-tip
//!   advertisements.
//! - Sync requests/responses: request and deliver block chunks and block headers
//!   during chain sync.
//! - RPC requests/responses: direct peer-to-peer RPCs for queries such as fetching
//!   network info, UTXOs, mempool contents, broadcasting transactions/blocks, and
//!   fetching block summaries.
